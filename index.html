                Better than Heaven or Arcadia
                I love thee, O my India!
                And thy love I shall give
                To every brother nation that lives.
                God made the Earth;
                Man made confining countries
                And their fancy-frozen boundaries.
                But with unfound boundless love
                I behold the borderland of my India
                Expanding into the World.
                Hail, mother of religions, lotus, scenic beauty,and sages!
                Thy wide doors are open,
                Welcoming God's true sons through all ages.
                Where Ganges, woods, Himalayan caves, and
                men dream God -
                I am hallowed; my body touched that sod.
